这是我用easyX图形库写的一个很简陋的植物大战僵尸，只开发了豌豆和向日葵，我的源代码在main分支的bingb的源.cpp里面。我的资源文件全放在master分支里面，包括卡牌的图片，音乐等。
This is a very simple Plants vs. Zombies game that I wrote using the easyX graphics library. I have only developed the pea shooter and sunflower. My source code is in the source.cpp file of the main directory. All my resource files are in the master directory, including card images, music, etc.
